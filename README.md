I developed a task manager web application called DoDesk that enables users to efficiently create, assign, and manage tasks. The platform supports secure user authentication with sign-up and login functionality, ensuring a protected user experience.

Key features include:

Task Management: Users can create tasks with detailed descriptions and assign them to other users.
1. Role-Based Actions: Task assigners have the ability to delete tasks, while assignees can mark tasks as completed.
2. Task Categorization: Tasks are organized into three categories — *Assignment, Minor Project, and Major Project — to help streamline workflow.
3. Notifications: Users receive timely alerts for upcoming deadlines and task updates.
4. Status Tracking: Tasks can be tracked based on their status — either *Pending or Completed — for better progress monitoring.

Technologies used:

1. Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
2. Backend: Node.js with Express.js, including routing and middleware
3. Database: MongoDB

This project emphasizes both functionality and user experience, making task collaboration simple and effective.
